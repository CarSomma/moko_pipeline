# Mock Pipeline 🪈

## Overview

This project is a data pipeline that automatically extracts data from the endpoint of a FastAPI service, normalizes the data, and loads it into a PostgreSQL database. Additionally, it includes service that performs real-time analytics using Dash and aggregates analytics. The pipeline consists of five main components:

1. **FastAPI Service**: Exposes an endpoint to generate fake data and stream it.
2. **MongoDB**: Stores the raw data streamed from the FastAPI service.
3. **ETL (Extract, Transform, Load) Job Service**: Extracts data from MongoDB via FastApi service, normalizes it, and loads it into PostgreSQL.
4. **PostgreSQL Database**: Stores the normalized data.
All components are containerized using Docker.
5. **Dashboard app with Dash**: Build Dashboards of aggregate analytics using Dash.


## Requirements

- Docker
- Python 3.11
- FastAPI
- MongoDB
- Dlt
- Dash

## Installation

1. Clone this repository:

```bash
git clone git@github.com:CarSomma/moko_pipeline.git
```

2. Build the Docker images:

```bash
docker-compose build
```

3. Start the services:

```bash
docker-compose up -d
```

4. Access the FastAPI service:

```bash
http://localhost:8000/docs
```

5. Access the MongoDB database:

```bash
docker exec -it <name-mongobd-container> mongosh
show dbs
use <name-database>
show collection
db.<collection-name>.find()
```

## Usage

The FastAPI service automatically generates fake data upon startup and streams it to MongoDB. Additionally, a Dash app for real-time analytics is mounted to one of the FastAPI endpoint. The ETL job service extracts data from MongoDB using a GET request to the provided endpoint, normalizes it, and loads it into the PostgreSQL database.

### Access FastAPI Data Stream

You can access the data stream from the FastAPI service by sending a GET request to the endpoint `/fetch_data_from_mongo`.

Example:

```bash
curl http://localhost:8000/fetch_data_from_mongo
```

### Access PostgreSQL Normalized data

You can access the normalized data in PostgreSQL by accessing the postgresql container shell:

```bash
docker exec -it <name-postgres-container> psql -U <postgres-user> -d <postgres-database>
```
```sql
SELECT * from <schema>.<table_name>;
```
## Configuration

- FastAPI configurations can be modified in the `data_collector/fast_app.py` file.
- MongoDB configurations can be modified in the `docker-compose.yaml` file.
- PostgreSQL configurations can be modified in the docker-compose.yaml file.
